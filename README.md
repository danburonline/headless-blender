# Headless Blender

This repository is an experimental side project to determine the feasibility of running Blender in headless mode, without a graphical user interface (GUI), while still being able to render images and run simulations.

## Quick Start

- Open the project via the Poetry shell: `poetry shell`
- Install the project dependencies: `poetry install`
- Run the project: `blender -b -P src/self_fracture.py`
